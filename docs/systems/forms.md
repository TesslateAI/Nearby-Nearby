# Public Forms System

## Overview

The platform provides 5 public form endpoints for user engagement. These forms are accessible without authentication and are designed with defense-in-depth security.

**Note**: `/suggest-place` redirects to `/claim-business` for backward compatibility.

## Security Architecture (Defense in Depth)

| Layer | What | Protects Against |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **1. DB Role** | `nearby_forms` role — can only INSERT/SELECT on form tables | SQL injection escalating to POI data |
| **2. Separate Engine** | `FORMS_DATABASE_URL` env var → dedicated SQLAlchemy engine | Code bugs using wrong session |
| **3. Pydantic** | Strict schemas with `Field(max_length=...)`, `EmailStr` | Malformed input, oversized payloads |
| **4. Rate Limiting** | `slowapi` — 5/min on form endpoints, 2/min on file uploads | Spam, DoS |
| **5. File Validation** | Content-type check, 10MB limit, image-only, max 10 files | Malicious uploads |

### Database Isolation

```python
# nearby-app/backend/app/database.py

# Main engine (read-only POI access)
engine = create_engine(settings.DATABASE_URL)

# Forms engine (isolated: nearby_forms role, INSERT/SELECT only)
_forms_url = settings.FORMS_DATABASE_URL or settings.DATABASE_URL
forms_engine = create_engine(_forms_url)

# Dependency injection
def get_forms_db():
    db = FormsSessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
```

All form endpoints use `Depends(get_forms_db)` instead of `Depends(get_db)`.

### Graceful Fallback

If `FORMS_DATABASE_URL` is empty or not set, falls back to `DATABASE_URL` (superuser). This means:
- **Local dev without the role**: Still works, just no table-level isolation
- **Production**: Uses restricted `nearby_forms` role for real security

## Environment Variables

| Variable | App | Purpose |
|----------|-----|---------|
| `FORMS_DATABASE_URL` | nearby-app | Connection string for forms DB role |
| `AWS_S3_BUCKET` | nearby-app | S3 bucket for feedback file uploads |
| `AWS_REGION` | nearby-app | AWS region |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | nearby-app | S3 credentials |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | nearby-app | S3 credentials |
| `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` | nearby-app | MinIO endpoint (dev only) |

---

## Frontend Pages

All form pages follow a consistent pattern:
- Form card with header icon and description
- Client-side validation with disabled submit until valid
- Loading state during submission
- Success screen with confirmation message
- Error handling for network failures and validation errors

### Routes

| Route | Component | Replaces |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `/community-interest` | `CommunityInterest.jsx` | Google Form link in footer |
| `/contact` | `Contact.jsx` | New page |
| `/feedback` | `Feedback.jsx` | Google Form link in footer |
| `/claim-business` | `ClaimBusiness.jsx` | `/suggest-place` (SuggestPlace.jsx) |
| `/suggest-place` | Redirect → `/claim-business` | Backward compatibility |

### Footer Links Updated

The footer's "Get Involved" column now uses internal `<Link>` components instead of external Google Forms URLs:
- "Share Your Feedback" → `/feedback`
- "Claim Your Business" → `/claim-business`
- "Community Interest" → `/community-interest`
- "Contact Us" → `/contact`

## Testing

23 integration tests in `tests/test_form_endpoints.py`:

| Class | Tests | What's Covered |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| `TestWaitlist` | 5 | Add email, duplicate (409), invalid email, missing email, count |
| `TestCommunityInterest` | 4 | Minimal (location only), full submission, missing location, location too long |
| `TestContact` | 4 | Submit, message too short, missing name, missing email |
| `TestFeedback` | 5 | Text only, with email, too short, invalid file type, file too large |
| `TestBusinessClaims` | 5 | Submit, full submission, missing required fields, invalid email, name too long |

The `forms_client` fixture creates form tables via raw SQL (since they aren't in AdminBase.metadata) and overrides both `get_db` and `get_forms_db` to use the test session.

---

## Migration

The Alembic migration `c3f4g5h6i7j8_create_form_tables.py` creates:
1. Five tables (waitlist, community_interest, contact_submissions, feedback_submissions, business_claims)
2. The `nearby_forms` PostgreSQL role with restricted permissions
3. Grants INSERT and SELECT on form tables to the role

Run on production: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend alembic upgrade head`

## Deleted Files

The forms system replaced several SQLite-based files:

| Deleted File | Replacement |
|-------------|-------------|
| `nearby-app/backend/app/waitlist_db.py` | ORM model + PostgreSQL |
| `nearby-app/backend/app/suggestions_db.py` | `business_claim.py` model |
| `nearby-app/backend/app/api/endpoints/suggestions.py` | `business_claims.py` endpoint |
| `nearby-app/backend/app/schemas/suggestion.py` | `business_claim.py` schema |
| `nearby-app/app/src/pages/SuggestPlace.jsx` | `ClaimBusiness.jsx` |
| `tests/test_suggestions.py` | `test_form_endpoints.py` |
