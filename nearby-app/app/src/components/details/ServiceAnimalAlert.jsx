        Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), service animals are
        permitted in all areas where members of the public are allowed to go,
        regardless of the venue's general pet policy. A service animal is a
        dog (or in some cases a miniature horse) individually trained to
        perform work or tasks for a person with a disability. Emotional
        support, comfort, or therapy animals are not classified as service
        animals under the ADA.
