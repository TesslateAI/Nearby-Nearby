"""Issue #70 — verify consolidation of holiday_hours into hours.holidays.

Holiday hours now live only at the nested `hours.holidays` JSONB key. The
legacy top-level `points_of_interest.holiday_hours` column has been renamed
to `_deprecated_holiday_hours` by Alembic migration g70_001, with a one-way
backfill into `hours.holidays`.

These tests assert:

* The admin form's canonical store accepts and returns `hours.holidays`.
* The CRUD response does NOT expose the deprecated `holiday_hours` top-level
  key.
* Even if a payload sends a top-level `holiday_hours` (legacy clients), the
  Pydantic schema strips it silently so it never lands in the DB.
* Direct SQL backfill from legacy column → nested key still works on a
  database that has the legacy column (mirroring the migration's behavior).

Note: the integration test harness has a pre-existing bcrypt-72-byte issue at
fixture setup time; these tests are written to pass once that environmental
problem is resolved.
