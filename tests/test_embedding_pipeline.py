"""End-to-end embedding pipeline test (Shared phase).

This is the "CI test of derivation" for the embedding feature: it exercises the
WRITE path (admin embed-on-write -> stored vector) and the READ path
(nearby-app multi-signal semantic search -> relevant nearest neighbour) against
a REAL pgvector column, using a deterministic, hermetic mock embedding client
(no torch, no TEI, no network).

It complements test_embed_on_write.py (which proves fail-soft ROBUSTNESS with a
DISABLED client). Here the client is ENABLED, so the vector is actually stored
and actually drives a semantic match.

Key contracts asserted:
  * conftest creates the unmapped ``embedding vector(768)`` column + HNSW index.
  * write_embedding_best_effort populates that column (NON-NULL) for a POI.
  * a query sharing tokens with the document ranks the POI in semantic search.
  * fail-soft still holds: with NO mock (disabled client) the write no-ops and
    search still returns keyword results.
