@Rhonda Jean Not able to reproduce. Working as Desired. Can you reload the Error image (In JPEG or PNG). The attached image format (in HEIC) is not readable.

@MANOSH MAJUMDAR @Manav M  This is the Error I get Failed to Save Draft: HTTP 422 when I hit Publish. 

IMG_0461.jpg

And when I hit save draft - it does then let me hit publish but nothing actually saves in the various fields I enter information in besides the title. I’m also now getting the loading circle of doom and photos don’t upload.  

It should be: 
- publish makes the post go live
- save draft should just have the info saved on the backend - I noticed our draft posts are also showing on the front end.

Can't Save New POI's



Description

Just providing a quick status update: As of October 30th, I'm  unable to save any new POI details. The issue persists regardless of the information entered.  Right now, it looks like it auto saves, almost as soon as I create the new POI, but even when adding the POI name, it won’t save.

This work item involved investigating an issue where new POI details could not be saved, with errors occurring during save attempts.

Multiple attempts to save POIs resulted in HTTP 500 errors, with only the POI name and image saving successfully, while other fields did not save.

It was identified that the error might be a temporary server glitch, as saving via "Publish" sometimes succeeded, but "Save Draft" consistently failed to save entered data.

The next step involves further validation and troubleshooting to determine if the server error is persistent and to implement a fix, potentially assigned to the development team.

@MANOSH MAJUMDAR So I tried again and I am still getting an error.. HTTP 500

I made a recording to show what I am experiencing. SO I made a sample listing of just the free version this time.. where I clicked and filled out everything I could to make sure it's all saving correctly.  I get the HTTP 500 Error when I click both the Publish OR the Save Draft. – There is sound but you can mute it – it recorded my tv talking and I didn’t talk in video. 

THEN I went to the dashboard and noticed that something did save.. and it looks like it oddly ONLY saved the image I uploaded and the POI name but none of the fields I filled out saved. - Also you can mute this one, I didn’t record me saying anything - it recorded my TV.

@Rhonda Jean HTTP error might be a temporary glitch with the server. Please try again. I just created a test POI and clicked Publish (without Save Draft) - It saved.

@MANOSH MAJUMDAR  I just tried making a new poi and Publish didn’t work gave me a Http Error, so then I did the Save draft and reviewed the new poi I just entered,  nothing I entered or checked saved, except the photos I uploaded.

Backend Map/Address



Description

Don’t want to spend too much time here, especially if we are to move over to GIS for disaster aspect. But these are issues that we need to consider for when we have user side of entering information. 

1. On the backend is there a way to zoom in more. I spend a stupid amount of time zooming in. Currently it looks like:

Screenshot 2025-11-05 at 4.23.00 PM.png
And can we get the standard zoom closer to something like this:

Screenshot 2025-11-05 at 4.23.38 PM.png
Address Auto Complete - Is this something we tackle now? I personally keep spelling things wrong and it’s getting frustrating. I also spend a lot of time re-entering the same info over and over… If autocomplete isn’t smart now especially with wanting to tackle GIS sooner than later..  the very least can we do this for now:

Can we have a drop down for the City/Towns: Have it currently set on just Pittsboro as thats where we are focused on but also make it easy to add or have it easy for you to add the other city/towns as NN expands into in rest of chatham County. So like our incorporated and unincorporated towns. 

Same with Chatham County - can just have that there and I don’t need to type it in every time for now. Especially since we will probably be focused on Chatham for next 4-5 months.

Same with State, have it just set on NC for now.

The other big thing, but that isn’t a big thing for MVP is that if I type in a address it automatically moves the map pin point to that location then if needed I can move the map pin point to fine tune and get Lat & Long location?

All I get on a desktop and mobile is link Copied. I don’t get the other options.. but probably something that will be re-tackled when @Lekhana Vankayala rebuilds the POI pages.

Added Hours toggle - Quick info section now has a "Show Hours" button that expands to show all weekly hours
This also doesn’t work/show but again probably something that will be re-tackled when @Lekhana Vankayala rebuilds the POI pages.

Hours Front End & Back End



Description

So I put my thoughts into ChatGPT to try to translate what I mean - 

Here’s a clearer, developer-ready explanation you can give your team.

I’ve broken it into current problems, requested backend changes, and requested frontend behavior, plus examples and notes.

 

 

 

✅ Hours Functionality — Requirements Clarification
 

 

 

1) Current Issues
 

 

 

A) Regular Hours — Limited Exception Logic
 

 

Many businesses do not follow simple weekly patterns.

Examples we are seeing:

 

Closed only the 3rd Wednesday of each month

Closed every Sunday except the 1st Sunday of the month

 

 

Right now, the backend UI does not support inputting these types of recurring exceptions.

 

 

 

B) Seasonal Hours — Missing Date Range
 

 

We currently allow seasonal hours, but we cannot specify the season date range (e.g., “Summer hours valid June 1 – Aug 15”).

 

We need the ability to define:

 

Start date

End date

 

 

…so the platform can apply that schedule automatically.

 

 

 

C) Frontend Display — Exceptions & Holidays Not Overriding
 

 

On the listing page, the user should see the hours that apply for the date range being viewed — including holidays and exceptions.

 

Currently, the frontend continues to display default weekly hours even if:

 

Holiday hours exist

Exception hours exist

Seasonal hours apply

 

 

This leads to inaccurate or misleading information.

 

 

 

2) Required Backend Enhancements
 

 

 

✅ A) Add Support for Recurring Monthly Exceptions
 

 

We need a way to store recurring exception rules such as:

 

Closed every 3rd Wednesday

Open only the 1st Sunday

Closes early every 2nd Friday

 

 

Suggested capability:

 

Frequency logic (e.g., nth weekday of month)

Override open/closed

Override time (e.g., open 11a instead of 8a)

 

 

This could be structured similar to iCal recurrence rules.

 

 

 

✅ B) Seasonal Hours Must Include Date Range
 

 

Seasonal hours must allow:

 

Season name (optional)

Start date

End date

Daily hours pattern within that range

 

 

The system should automatically activate seasonal hours during that date window.

 

 

 

3) Required Frontend Behavior
 

 

 

✅ Display Most Relevant Hours for the Date Range
 

 

When viewing a business detail page OR browsing a specific date window (e.g., Thanksgiving week), the hours shown should:

 

Check exception hours first

Then check holiday hours

Then check seasonal hours (in range)

Then fall back to regular hours

 

 

 

 

✅ Override Example — Thanksgiving Week
 

 

Standard Weekly Hours



Mon 8–5
Tue 8–5
Wed 8–5
Thu 8–5
Fri 8–5
Sat 8–5
Sun 8–5
Thanksgiving Week Overrides

 

Wed → closes early at 12pm

Thu → closed

Fri → closed

Sat → opens late at 11am

 

 

Displayed to user



Mon 8–5
Tue 8–5
Wed 8–12   (special hours)
Thu Closed for Thanksgiving   (holiday closure)
Fri Closed   (holiday)
Sat 11–5   (special hours)
Sun 8–5
We need:

✅ overridden hours to replace regular hours

✅ visual indicator that these are special hours

✅ label OR tooltip showing:

 

“Closing early”

“Modified hours”

“Holiday hours”

 

 

Something simple like:



Wed 8–12 (Modified)
Thu Closed (Thanksgiving)
Sat 11–5 (Modified)
 

 

 

4) Optional Nice-to-Have
 

 

Tooltip or hover note explaining why the hours changed

(ex: “Holiday hours for Thanksgiving” or “Exception: 3rd Wed closed”)

Frontend messaging like:

“Hours for the week of Nov 25–Dec 1 reflect holiday adjustments.”

 

 

 

 

Summary for Development
 

 

 

Must-Have Data Features
 

 

✅ Recurring monthly exceptions

✅ Seasonal hours date ranges

✅ Holiday/exception hours override logic

✅ Ability to store modified open/close times

 

 

Must-Have Display Features
 

 

✅ Show correct hours based on date range

✅ Indicate modified/holiday hours

✅ Clearly override default schedule

 

 

If you want, I can also translate this into:

✅ Jira ticket format

✅ Data structure proposal

✅ UI wireframe suggestion

 

Just tell me what format you prefer.

@MANOSH MAJUMDAR backend looks fantastic!! 
The front end hours isn’t available for me to view yet as the design isn’t done for me to verify that it works on front end.  So leaving this open just to see how this works on front end.

Entity-Level Data Inheritance & Asset Association For Events



Description

For media handling, we need to structure photos so they are logically associated with the parent entity rather than dumped into a single global bucket.

Each business, venue, park, trail, etc. should function as a primary object with its own media records. Within that, images should be typed or tagged by function (e.g., storefront, entrance, restrooms, parking, interior, etc.) so the system can automatically reference or reuse them later.

This enables other objects, like events, to inherit contextual data from their venue source.

When an event organizer selects Havoc Brewing as the location, the system should be able to pre-populate details already stored at the venue level—address, parking instructions, accessibility details, restroom availability, etc.—instead of forcing duplicate entry. The goal is to ensure data is reusable, normalized, and non-duplicative.

So the architectural expectation is something like:

Venue/Business = canonical source of truth

 

Metadata fields (address, parking notes, accessibility, etc.)

Associated, categorized photos

 

Events reference a venue rather than duplicate venue data

 

On event creation, users can “pull from venue” to pre-fill optional fields

If a venue record updates, future events can optionally inherit the changes

 

We are not looking to store media in one giant bucket with no organization.

We are looking for entity-scoped assets with typed categorization so the system can:

Keep data clean

Prevent duplication

Enable downstream objects (events) to reuse venue-level context

This keeps venue information authoritative and ensures consistency across the platform.

Note moved from task NN-25: Map Look
Resolved
 

Map’s look a little more like google/mapquest/Apple Maps.. with coloring. Like Parks are green, water is blue, highways are yellow or whatnot.. ?? Official MapQuest - Maps, Driving Directions, Live Traffic 

Then can we add the boarders/lines for the county of Chatham, town of Pittsboro, Siler City, etc?  Or what is the process?@Manav M

@Manav M and @MANOSH MAJUMDAR The main background color we have makes it look like mush under color blind simulators. Looking more to fit the look of other maps systems - like Mapquest that I mentioned earlier.

Also in this image what are those random boxes when you zoom out a bit?

Overall Design



Description

I’ll be uploading this to Figma as I didn’t realize it wasn’t on there!! Waiting for SVG file to do so!

I’ll make the changes on figma that I have marked on here along with a few others. 

The Hours - Open Now - the way we have it which isn’t designed out in Figma is a button that can be clicked and the rest of the hours show if possible. Otherwise if we can’t do that nicely just have current hours there. 

Right now the directions button dosen’t work, it gives me nothing 

Lat & Long doesn’t copy the lat and long it gives me a null 

Share - is there a way to format our shares so they look better on social?  I will be sharing a lot from here on Facebook our biggest marketing and it would be nice if things looked better. 

Then the formatting within the accordions need to be done! I’ll break those up individually into new tasks.

(Do First!!) Business Page Frontend/Backend



Description

FRONTEND:

Here is the design for the content within the Accordions in figma - https://www.figma.com/design/4Ps9wwBmJOwXizWDAkSaKM/Oct-2025-Launch?node-id=2150-19429&t=7WHjULGBXgqHlPd9-1Connect your Figma account 

Waiting on current SVG file to update that top section in figma- this layout is more what we are going for vs whats in FIGMA but figma is close. 

Preview unavailable

BACKEND:

Two things:

for the Links with Reservations, Delivery Service, Online Ordering - is there a way to title the link? So for example if a business puts in a DoorDash link - instead of showing a bunch of long links - they can title it DoorDash?  Or if they put in a Calendrly link or what not for an appointment they can title it Schedule a 30 min consult. 

Same goes for the Community Connections articles - can we allow them to put a custom title in that shows for the link?

Missing Photos upload for the Rental Information section. 

Also in the Rental Information Section you can completely remove the rental pricing box, I’ll have people put pricing if they want into the paragraph section thats already there.. but I will not be using that anymore. 

 

To make frontend/back end easier?
For that amenities section - should we combine these sections in one place so its easier to grab the code from all of these for front end: It would make it easier for everyone I think if they were all together.

In Idea FOR the LOCAL & SPECIAL section only (moving night owls open late to social settings)

Photos!!! From Sections into Gallery! & Source Info



Description

So I like the way yelp has the gallery broken into photo sections everything in main gallery then broken up on depending on what it is being photographed- Havoc Brewing Company - Pittsboro, NC 

Can we do the same?  That way all the photos of an entry are in the same place, restrooms, etc?

For media handling, we need to structure photos so they are logically associated with the parent entity rather than dumped into a single global bucket.

Each business, venue, park, trail, etc. should function as a primary object with its own media records. Within that, images should be typed or tagged by function (e.g., storefront, entrance, restrooms, parking, interior, etc.) so the system can automatically reference or reuse them later.

This enables other objects, like events, to inherit contextual data from their venue source.

When an event organizer selects Havoc Brewing as the location, the system should be able to pre-populate details already stored at the venue level—address, parking instructions, accessibility details, restroom availability, etc.—instead of forcing duplicate entry. The goal is to ensure data is reusable, normalized, and non-duplicative.

So the architectural expectation is something like:

Venue/Business = canonical source of truth

 

Metadata fields (address, parking notes, accessibility, etc.)

Events reference a venue rather than duplicate venue data

 

On event creation, users can “pull from venue” to pre-fill optional fields

Points on Map Info



Description

Is there a way to have it instead of having these pop ups within the map. 

Preview unavailable
That instead its somehow connected to the POI list bellow the map? That if they clicked #1 for instance it would bring that card up below front and center. A bit like how Google Maps works? 

I’m not sure what we should/could do here. But it would be nice if we had something cleaner/more connected?

Events



Description

With Events on the Nearby feature, I think were going to really have to pay attention to this. However, we need to make sure that once as an event passes it no longer shows on the nearby feature. As I add more events, we will have to see what it does to the nearby features.

Directions (button) on Nearby Cards/Listings



Description

When you hit the direction button on the cards. Can we possibly add copy for lat and long here and copy for address??

I’ve also added icons to use, I'm not a fan of the emoji type icons. 

Also, can you make the size of that pop up way smaller on desktop.. looks weird being so large.

Copy Address only copies the city Pittsboro.

Can we make this pop up smaller?

As noted previously - here are the icon images for the listings - Logos for Map - Google Drive
 

The Grey buttons need to at least be the Purple buttons, they don’t look active as grey buttons. 

And the Colors for the Apple, Google, and Waze we need to make them all the same color.. and the Wyze button isn’t accessible with the light blue and white icon.. so my vote is sticking with our purple button setup.

@Rhonda Jean Its not smart to load a png for each file icon, it will cause performance delays. You have to pic an icon library

Figma Design - https://www.figma.com/design/4Ps9wwBmJOwXizWDAkSaKM/Oct-2025-Launch?node-id=2007-55883&t=7WHjULGBXgqHlPd9-1Connect your Figma account 

The Outline of the Card is Yellow #FEC764

Number purple numbers is centered

The miles from is above the business name - and the miles part is purple I believe Simi bold so it stands out

For Hours it’s current hours like it is

If the date search is done its that days hours  so like if I did a search for Wednesday Nov 19th, it would show me Wednesday hours. 

Where it says plumbing that is the Primary Display Category

Under that is the icon shows if

They have public restrooms

Wheelchair friendly

Has free public wifi

Pet friendly

Please use icons from figma

@Lekhana Vankayala we will fine tune the front end design. 

@Manav M question - on the frontend if someone uses the date search - For Businesses and parks in particular are they only shown those POI’s that are opened?

Based on the transcript, here is the detailed actionable list for the Nearby Nearby system development. The project is currently in a "pre-MVP" phase with a 5-week deadline to have a functional site ready for a conference.

1. Immediate Setup & Workflow

Development Environment:

Robert: Install Docker (if not already used) to run the local environment.

Robert: Connect to the GitHub repository (Work on the dev branch, submit Pull Requests to Manive).

Manive/Robert: Ensure the local environment connects to the backend stack (Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, ElasticSearch).

Task Management:

Barry: Populate "Jarvis" (Jira) with detailed tickets/tasks by end of day Friday.

Robert: Review tickets and organize work based on a ~8–10 hour/week schedule.

Assets Handover:

Barry: Provide SVGs for all icons and logos.

Barry: Provide the SCSS (Sass) file with variables and breakpoints.

2. Front-End Architecture & Standards

Accessibility (Critical):

Standard: Must be AAA Compliant (due to legal risks).

Colors: Use only the specific accessible colors defined in the Figma file.

Navigation: Ensure full keyboard accessibility (Tab/Enter keys must navigate the menu and read out via screen readers).

Code Structure: Use <button> tags for interactive elements (like the search overlay toggle) to ensure JavaScript targeting and accessibility compliance.

SEO Structure:

Maintain strict header hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3) on all pages.

Responsive Design:

Approach: Mobile-first design, but optimized for Desktop (primary demographic usage).

Breakpoints: Use the specific breakpoints provided in Barry’s SCSS file.

Mobile UI: Ensure the bottom navigation bar is fixed/sticky on mobile devices.

3. Component Development (The "Punch List")

Header:

Implement responsive design (Hamburger menu for mobile, full nav for desktop).

Banner: Add a "Beta/Location" banner at the very top stating: "We are currently only in Pittsboro" (to manage user expectations regarding geolocation).

Footer:

Implement the multi-layer design (Newsletter section, Feedback section, Links, Socials, Logo).

Newsletter: Connect the email input to the existing backend collection point (coordinate with Manive on where this data goes).

Search Overlay (The "One Search"):

Functionality: Clicking "Search" takes over the entire screen (overlay).

Logic: Needs to handle the 4 search types:

Specific POI (Directs to POI Page).

Missing POI (Prompts to add).

Specialized Zone (e.g., "Jordan Lake" - Design pending).

Keyword/Mood (e.g., "Adventurous" -> Results map).

Default Page Template:

Create a reusable wrapper class (Max-width 1400px on desktop, 80% width on mobile).

4. Page Implementation (MVP Priorities)

Home Page:

Implement the main "One Search" bar.

Categories: implement the 4 MVP categories: Businesses, Parks, Trails, Events (Remove Services, Youth Activities, and Volunteer for now).

Blog Feed: Implement a section to pull and display blog posts via RSS feed from the external WordPress environment.

Single POI Page (Point of Interest):

Ref: Use the "Rustic Spoon" or "Circle City Ice Cream" designs.

Gallery: Display photos. (Future state: categorized like TripAdvisor; MVP state: display available photos).

Nearby Feature: Display "What's nearby" relative to the current POI (crucial feature).

Explore/Map Pages:

Note: Designs for these are being finalized by Barry/Rhonda next week.

Action: Robert to wait for final design before coding complex map filters.

5. Backend Integration (Robert & Manive)

Search Logic: Robert to style the UI; Manive to handle the search query routing.

Events: Ensure the "Add Event" functionality is working (Manive fixing current glitches).

Data Feeds: Ensure the Home Page categories populate correctly from the database.

6. Timeline & Milestones

Weekly Check-in: Mondays via Slack.

Goal: Functional MVP (Header, Footer, Home, Search, Single POI) in 5 weeks for the conference.

Design Freeze: Barry and Rhonda to finish outstanding designs (Explore page, Events list) by next week.
