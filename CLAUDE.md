## High-Level Architecture

### Domain Model
The system manages four POI types with shared base attributes and extensive type-specific fields:
- **Business**: Pricing tiers, business hours, payment methods, rich text descriptions, gallery images, menu/booking systems
- **Park**: Drone policies, outdoor amenities, facilities, entry photos, playground features, hunting/fishing options
- **Trail**: Difficulty levels, trail length, route types, trailhead coordinates, exit points, downloadable maps
- **Event**: Start/end times, venue relationships, costs, vendor management, entry details, event-specific amenities

### Data Architecture
- **PostGIS Integration**: All POIs have geospatial `location` field for proximity queries with front door coordinates
- **JSONB Fields**: Extensive flexible schema for photos, hours, amenities, compliance, facilities, venue settings
- **Image Storage**: Binary storage system with multiple image types (main, gallery, entry, parking, restroom, rental, playground, menu, trail_head, trail_exit, map, downloadable_map)
- **Rich Text Content**: HTML storage for long descriptions with TipTap editor integration
- **Relationship System**: POI-to-POI relationships with type validation (venue, trail-in-park, service provider)
- **Dynamic Attributes**: Admin-configurable attributes and categories without code changes
- **Publication System**: Draft/published states with complete form validation

### API Structure
- **RESTful Design**: `/api/pois/`, `/api/categories/`, `/api/attributes/`, `/api/relationships/`, `/api/images/`
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with `/api/auth/` endpoints
- **Image Management**: `/api/images/` with upload, retrieval, and metadata endpoints
- **Search Capabilities**: Text search, location-based search, nearby POI discovery
- **Auto-documentation**: Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8001/docs` (backend port 8001)

### Frontend Architecture

#### Organization Structure
- **Component-Focused Architecture**: Organized by component type with specialized directories
- **Core Components**: `POIForm/`, `maps/`, `common/`, `ImageUpload/`, `relationships/` for reusable UI elements
- **Modular POI Form**: Completely reorganized from single 3,400+ line file into structured sections:
  - `sections/`: CoreInformation, Categories, Contact, BusinessDetails, LocationSection, etc.
  - `hooks/`: usePOIForm, usePOIHandlers for form logic
  - `constants/`: initialValues, validationRules, helpers
  - `components/`: FormActions and other form-specific components
- **Pages**: Route-level containers (`pages/`) that compose components

#### State Management
- **Context API**: `AuthContext` for global authentication state with JWT token management
- **Mantine Forms**: `useForm` hook for complex local form state with validation
- **Custom Hooks**: Domain-specific API hooks (`usePOI`, `useCategories`, `useRelationships`) with integrated loading/error states

#### Component Patterns
- **Accordion-Based Forms**: POIForm with section-based architecture using Mantine Accordion
- **Rich Text Editing**: TipTap integration with @mantine/tiptap for HTML content editing
- **Image Management**: Dedicated ImageUpload component with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Section Validation**: Progressive form validation with conditional field rendering
- **Form Controllers**: Centralized form logic with `constants/`, `hooks/`, and `utils/` organization

#### Routing & Navigation
- **React Router v6**: Public routes (`/poi/detail/{id}`) and protected admin routes
- **Route Protection**: `ProtectedRoute` component with authentication checks
- **Conditional Layouts**: AppShell for admin, minimal layout for public pages
- **Dynamic Parameters**: Edit/detail views with programmatic navigation

#### API Layer Architecture
- **Base API Service**: Centralized HTTP client with automatic auth headers and token expiration handling
- **Domain Hooks**: `useApi` with specialized hooks per feature (POI, categories, relationships)
- **Secure Storage**: JWT persistence with client-side expiration checking
- **Notification Integration**: Automatic success/error feedback via Mantine notifications

#### Design System
- **Mantine UI v8.3.1**: Latest version with enhanced components and accessibility features
- **Component Theming**: Consistent styling patterns across Button, Paper, Table, Accordion components
- **Icon System**: @tabler/icons-react for consistent iconography
- **Animation System**: CSS transitions in `animations.css`
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Mantine's responsive utilities
- **Rich Media**: Advanced dropzone for file uploads with preview functionality

#### Performance & UX
- **Error Boundaries**: Component-level error containment
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading management through custom hooks
- **Optimistic Updates**: Client-side state updates with API synchronization
- **Code Organization**: Structured for potential lazy loading and code splitting

### Testing Strategy
- **Isolated Test Environment**: Separate `test-db` container
- **Clean State**: Each test gets fresh database via schema drop/recreate
- **Auth Mocking**: Tests bypass authentication with override dependencies
- **Fixtures**: `conftest.py` provides `client` and `db_session` fixtures

## Key Development Patterns

### Adding New POI Fields
1. Update SQLAlchemy model in `backend/app/models/poi.py` (or specific type models like `business.py`, `event.py`, `trail.py`)
2. Create Alembic migration with `docker-compose exec backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"`
3. Update Pydantic schemas in `backend/app/schemas/poi.py`
4. Add field to appropriate POIForm section in `frontend/src/components/POIForm/sections/`
5. Update form constants and validation in `frontend/src/components/POIForm/constants/`
6. Consider image fields: update `backend/app/models/image.py` for new ImageType enum values
7. Extend field options if needed in `frontend/src/utils/fieldOptions.js`

### Creating API Endpoints
1. Add endpoint in `backend/app/api/endpoints/`
2. Use dependency injection for auth: `current_user = Depends(get_current_user_with_role)`
3. Follow CRUD pattern in `backend/app/crud/`
4. Add tests in `backend/tests/`

### Frontend Data Flow
1. **API Layer**: Base service in `frontend/src/services/api.js` and utilities in `frontend/src/utils/api.js`
2. **Custom Hooks**: Domain-specific hooks for POI, categories, relationships with integrated loading/error states
3. **Authentication**: Global state via `AuthContext.jsx` with secure token management in `secureStorage.js`
4. **Form Management**: Accordion-based forms with `useForm` hook, organized in POIForm sections with `usePOIForm` and `usePOIHandlers` hooks
5. **Image Management**: Dedicated ImageUpload component with binary storage, drag-and-drop, and preview functionality
6. **Rich Text**: TipTap editor integration for HTML content with @mantine/tiptap
7. **State Updates**: Optimistic updates with automatic sync and error rollback
8. **User Feedback**: Integrated notifications via `@mantine/notifications` for all API operations

## Important Considerations

### Security
- JWT tokens with configurable expiry (`ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- CORS configuration in `backend/app/main.py`
- Input validation via Pydantic schemas

### Performance
- PostGIS spatial indexing for geospatial queries
- JSONB indexing for flexible attribute queries
- Pagination support in list endpoints
- Docker layer caching for faster builds

### Environment Configuration
- `.env` file required with database credentials and image storage paths
- Separate test database configuration
- CORS origins configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- Production domain support via `PRODUCTION_DOMAIN`
- Image storage configuration: `IMAGE_STORAGE_PATH` and `IMAGE_BASE_URL`
- Frontend API base URL: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

## Workflow Preferences
- Focus only on task-relevant code areas
- Write tests for major functionality
- Maintain existing patterns unless explicitly changing architecture
- Keep files under 300 lines (refactor when larger) - POIForm has been successfully modularized
- Never mock data for dev/prod environments
- Always preserve existing `.env` configuration
- Use component-based organization following the POIForm modular pattern
- Leverage TipTap for rich text editing needs
- Follow image upload patterns established in ImageUpload component
- **All utility scripts must be placed in the `scripts/` folder at the project root** (backend or frontend specific scripts stay in their respective folders)
